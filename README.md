This code tries to parse a database to get the total of activelicenses and their respective unixtimestamps. Addittionally it posts these results to a server using a post request. There are varied versions of this code in different branches, they show how the code evolved and became more optimized than the previous one. This program works as a CLI (Command Line Interface) each of the arguments have their own validations so that they do not break the program and they give an explicit error message to the user if they were used incorrectly.
